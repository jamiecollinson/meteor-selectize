# Selectize 

v0.12.1

[Selectize](http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/) is the hybrid of a textbox and `<select>` element. It's a jQuery-based plugin that can be used for tagging, contact lists, country selectors, and lots more.

This package is forked from [jeremy:selectize](https://github.com/jshimko/meteor-selectize) and includes the bootstrap 3 stylesheet instead of the default. I previously used [chhib:selectize-bootstrap-3](https://github.com/chhib/meteor-selectize-bootstrap-3) but the author hasn't updated to v0.12.1 which includes some fixes I required - notably fixing a bug in the silent flag for `selectize.setValue()`.

## Install

`meteor add jamiecollinson:selectize-bootstrap`

This Meteor package currently only loads the plugin with bootstrap 3 stylesheet.  Just add to your app and set it up manually as you would in any other application.
